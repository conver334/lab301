Ting Su is a Professor of Software Engineering Institute, East China Normal University, China (2020-). Previously, he was a postdoctoral scholar at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), Switzerland (2019-2020), in the group of Prof. [Zhendong Su](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/suz/). He got his Ph.D in computer science from East China Normal University ([ECNU](http://english.ecnu.edu.cn/)), Shanghai, China (2011-2016), and was surpervised by Prof. [Jifeng He](http://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/s/436/t/4475/main.jspy) and Prof. [Geguang Pu](http://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/s/1018/t/11459/main.jspy). He also had one-year visit in University of California, Davis ([UCD](https://www.ucdavis.edu/)), USA (2014-2015), and was advised by Prof. Zhendong Su. He worked as a postdoctoral research fellow with Prof. [Yang Liu](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/yangliu/index.html) in Cyber Security Lab (CSL), [NTU](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx), Singapore (2016-2019). He also worked as a software engineer in [Synopsys](https://www.synopsys.com/), and a research scientist in [Rolls-Royce@NTU Research Lab](http://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/rr-ntucorplab/) (2016-2017). He is a recipient of National Youth Talent Award in China.

His research focuses on developing effective methodologies, techniques and tools to improve software quality, reliability and security.
- [Mobile App Analysis and Testing (GUI Fuzzing)](https://mobile-app-analysis.github.io/)
- Symbolic Execution
- Fuzzing Compilers/Program Analyzers/Deep Learning Systems
- Formal Verification

His research work received generous support from Chinese NSF, Swiss NSF, Google, ByteDance, Ant Financial, NTUitive Gap Fund, and won 3 *ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Awards (ICSE 2018, ASE 2018, ASE 2019)*, 1 *Google Faculty Research Award* (2019-2020), 1 *Best Research Prototype Tool Award (NASAC 2017, First Place)*, and 1 *Golden Medal of ACM Student Research Competition (ICSE 2016, First Place)*. His research on symbolic execution has led to [**SmartRocket Unit**](https://www.ticpsh.com/tech/gnaqgj/cspg/dycsgj), a commercial automated unit testing tool, which is serving many companies in China for testing industrial embedded software; his continuous research on mobile app analysis and fuzzing has led to several tools and dataset ([**Stoat**](https://github.com/tingsu/Stoat) ([link](https://tingsu.github.io/files/stoat.html)), [**Themis**](https://github.com/the-themis-benchmarks/home), [**SetDroid**](https://github.com/setting-defect-fuzzing/home), [**Genie**](https://github.com/functional-fuzzing-android-apps/home)) and some techniques have been adopted by ByteDance's [**FastBot**](https://github.com/setting-defect-fuzzing/home) fuzzing engine ([more info](https://mobile-app-analysis.github.io/)).

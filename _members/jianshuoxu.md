# About me

I am a graduate student of Software Engineering Institute at East China Normal University, advised by Prof. Geguang Pu and Prof. Jianwen Li in the SSEL. Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Cyber Engineering from School of Software Engineering at Dalian University of Technology. 

My current research interests include formal verification and model checking. Also, I used to be a research assistant studying anomaly detection and social network.
